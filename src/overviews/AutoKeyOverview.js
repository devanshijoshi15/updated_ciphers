      The AutoKey Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher used for encryption. It enhances the Vigen√®re Cipher by incorporating the plaintext into the key. Initially, a short key is chosen, and then the plaintext itself is appended to this key. This method ensures that each letter is encrypted using a different shift value, making the encryption more secure. It's a more complex yet effective way to obscure text by using the plaintext to influence the key.
